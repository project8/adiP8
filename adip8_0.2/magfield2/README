magfield2
=========

by Sebastian Voecking <seb.voeck@uni-muenster.de>

This is a modified version of the magfield2 package by Ferenc Glueck. For
informations about his package see magfield2.pdf. The changes in this version
are:
- Fixed size arrays on the stack replaced by dynamic array on the heap. That
  solves some problem with segfaults on certain machines. This also removes some
  "hidden" limitations caused by the fixed array sizes.
- Improvement of frontend programs which makes the packages far easier to use.
  See below for usage instructions.
- Added makefile with compiler optimisation.
- Code cleaned up. No more warnings should appear during compilation.


Compilation

Just run "make" and everything should compile.

To create a shared library adjust the Makefile to your needs, especially the
PREFIX variable and OPT if you want. Then run "make library" and "make install".
You might need superuser privileges for the last step. It maybe that you need
to run "ldconfig" to let your linker know about the new library.


Usage

You can use magfield2 through the frontend program magmain which calculates the
magnetic source coeffitions from a given geometry file. And writes them to
magsource.dat. The syntax is:

magmain [-d DELZ0] [-m Z0MIN] [-M Z0MAX] [-t] <inputfile>

The options mean:
	-t Show some test output after calculation
	
The other options are the same as in the old magmain program.

Additional to this program you can use the magfield2 algorithm directly with
your own programs. To do that you need to create a library and install it. Then
you have to link your program against the library. For available functions see
magfield2.h.
