Adiabatic particle tracking for Project8.

To Compile (requires ROOT and FFTW3):
./configure
make

* the configure shell script is NOT a standard "configure" in that it does not create/modify a makefile.
It also does NOT check for dependencies. All it currently does is ensure the existence of the ./bin and ./tmp directories.

Wishlist:
~Produce a "proper" configure script to check for dependencies, create directories, and setup the makefile with your compiler.
